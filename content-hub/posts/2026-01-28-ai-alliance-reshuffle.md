## Core Message

**Hook:** Microsoft just invested $5B in Anthropic. Google is powering Siri. The AI alliances are reshuffling.

**Key Points:**
1. Microsoft invested $5B in Anthropic (hedging OpenAI bet)
2. Google won the Apple deal - Gemini powers Siri overhaul
3. $470B in AI spending from hyperscalers under ROI scrutiny
4. Anthropic raising $10B at $350B valuation, IPO coming
5. OpenAI targeting $1T IPO valuation
6. 2026 is the "show me the money" year

**Takeaway:** The AI race just got a lot more complicated. Alliances are shifting. Winners aren't decided yet.

The AI alliances just reshuffled.

And nobody's talking about it.

Here's what happened this week:

---

Microsoft invested $5 BILLION in Anthropic.

Yes, Microsoft.

The same Microsoft that bet $13B on OpenAI.

They're hedging.

Why? Because the AI race isn't over.

---

Meanwhile, Google just won the biggest AI deal of the decade:

Gemini is powering Apple's Siri overhaul.

Read that again.

Google. Inside every iPhone.

The company everyone said "lost" the AI race is now inside 2 billion devices.

---

The numbers this week are staggering:

→ Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon: $470B in AI spending for 2026
→ Anthropic raising $10B at $350B valuation (IPO coming)
→ OpenAI targeting $1 TRILLION IPO valuation
→ Anthropic revenue: $4.7B → $15B projected
→ OpenAI revenue: $13B → $30B projected

---

But here's what everyone's missing:

2026 is the "show me the money" year.

Investors aren't asking "what can AI do?"

They're asking "where's the ROI?"

$470 billion in spending needs to show results.

Or the music stops.

---

The power dynamics are shifting:

OLD NARRATIVE:
- Microsoft + OpenAI = unstoppable
- Google = behind
- Apple = no AI strategy

NEW REALITY:
- Microsoft hedging with Anthropic
- Google inside every iPhone
- Apple leveraging everyone's AI

---

Who's winning?

Nobody knows yet.

That's the point.

The AI race just entered its most unpredictable phase.

---

My take:

The companies that survive 2026 won't be the ones with the best models.

They'll be the ones that prove ROI.

Demos don't pay bills.
Deployments do.

"Microsoft just invested 5 BILLION dollars in Anthropic.

They're hedging their bets. Even they don't know who wins.

But wait—it gets crazier.

Google just landed inside every iPhone.

Gemini is powering Apple's new Siri.

The company everyone said LOST the AI race is now inside 2 billion devices.

Here's what nobody's saying:

2026 is the 'show me the money' year.

470 billion dollars in AI spending needs to show ROI.

Or the music stops.

The old story? Microsoft plus OpenAI equals unstoppable.

The new reality? Everyone's hedging. Nobody's won yet."

### YouTube Short Script (60s)

```
[HOOK - 0:00-0:03]
The AI alliances just reshuffled. Here's what happened.

[CONTENT - 0:03-0:50]
Microsoft invested 5 billion dollars in Anthropic this week.

That's the same Microsoft that put 13 billion into OpenAI.

Why hedge? Because even Microsoft doesn't know who wins the AI race.

Meanwhile, Google just landed the biggest AI deal of the decade.

Gemini is now powering Apple's Siri overhaul.

Google. Inside every iPhone. 2 billion devices.

The company everyone wrote off is now everywhere.

The numbers are staggering:
- 470 billion in AI spending from big tech
- Anthropic at 350 billion valuation
- OpenAI targeting a 1 TRILLION dollar IPO

But 2026 is the show-me-the-money year.

All that spending needs to show ROI.

[CTA - 0:50-0:60]
The AI race just got a lot more unpredictable.
